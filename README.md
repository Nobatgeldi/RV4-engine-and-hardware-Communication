# Communication between Real Virtuality 4 engine and hardware
I develop it for Arma 3 game. Now I can connect my DIY motion system to Arma 3 over serial port. 

# How it works
Using callExtension command of RV4 engine, system call DLL extension with angle of 3 axis of aircraft. So dll sends this angles to hardware via serial port.
